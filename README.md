What is a Repository Pattern?
It provides an abstraction layer between the application's business logic and the underlying data storage mechanism (e.g., Entity Framework Core, Dapper, raw SQL). 
This means the business logic doesn't need to know the specifics of how data is retrieved, saved, or updated.

**Advantages of Using Repository Pattern:**


 **Offering several key advantages:**
**Separation of Concerns:**
It decouples the application's business logic from the specifics of data persistence (e.g., database interactions, ORM details). This promotes cleaner code organization and makes the system more modular.
Testability:
By abstracting data access, the Repository pattern facilitates unit testing of business logic. You can easily mock or stub the repository interface during testing, eliminating the need for a live database connection and allowing for isolated testing of your application's core logic.
Flexibility and Maintainability:
It provides a centralized place for data access logic. If the underlying data storage technology changes (e.g., switching from SQL Server to a NoSQL database), only the repository implementation needs to be updated, not the entire application. This significantly improves maintainability and adaptability.
**Reduced Duplication:**
Common data access operations (CRUD operations) can be encapsulated within the repository, promoting code reusability and reducing redundant code across different parts of the application.

**Centralized Data Logic:**
It centralizes queries and data manipulation logic, making it easier to manage and enforce data consistency across the application.
Scalability:
The clear separation of concerns and ease of testing contribute to a more scalable architecture, as individual components can be developed and tested independently.
